setGameRunning has already been declared, so you just need to make it get invoked whenever the user clicks on the button (a topic covered in the first hint). 

The new value should be the opposite of the previous value. You can access the current value directly via the gameRunning state, and you can flip a boolean value to its opposite value by using the logical not operator (an exclamation mark !). For example:

    let exampleValue = true 

    exampleValue = !exampleValue 

exampleValue now equals false.
